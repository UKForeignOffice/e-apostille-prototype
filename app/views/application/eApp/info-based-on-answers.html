							<p class="govuk-body">Use this service to get the documents legalised with an electronic apostille (e-Apostille).</p>
							<p class="govuk-body">You can:</p>
							<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
								<li>upload documents you want to legalise, for example a passport, as a PDF</li>
								<li>upload multiple documents in a single PDF (for example a passport and a driving licence)</li>
								<li>pay Â£30 for each uploaded PDF, even if it contains multiple documents</li>
								<li>upload up to 50 PDFs in a single application</li>
								<li>avoid courier or postage costs</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="govuk-body">You need to:</p>
							<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
								<li>check if an e-Apostille will be accepted in the country in which you want to use it (no refund if an e-Apostille is not accepted)</li>
								<li>ensure all PDFs are notarised and digitally signed by a notary</li>
								<li>download the PDFs (including e-Apostilles) from your account within 21 days of the documents being legalised</li>
